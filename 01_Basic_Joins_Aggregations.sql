-- order amount to the least. In query #2, since you sorted by the total dollar
-- amount first, the orders appear from greatest to least regardless of which
-- account ID they were from. Then they are sorted by account ID next. 
-- (The secondary sorting by account ID is difficult to see here, since only if

-- 3- When you use the BETWEEN operator in SQL, do the results 
-- include the values of your endpoints, or not? Figure out the 
-- answer to this important question by writing a query that 
-- displays the order date and gloss_qty data for all orders where 
-- gloss_qty is between 24 and 29. Then look at your output to see 
-- if the BETWEEN operator included the begin and end values or not.

IMPORTANT: BETWEEN AND DATES
-- using BETWEEN is tricky for dates! While BETWEEN is generally inclusive of endpoints,
-- it assumes the time is at 00:00:00 (i.e. midnight) for dates. This is the reason
-- why we set the right-side endpoint of the period at '2017-01-01'.
